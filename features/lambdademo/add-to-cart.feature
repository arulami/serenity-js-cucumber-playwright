Feature: Login Functionality

  In order to learn how to use Serenity/JS with Cucumber and Playwright
  As a Curious Developer
  I'd like to see an example

  Background:
    Given Alice in the lambda site

  Scenario: Add Palm Treo Pro from Desktop category and verify cart

  ["The LambdaTest"](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) is an ecommerce application
  that found products on the web.
  Perfect for writing automated acceptance tests against ðŸ˜Ž
  With **Serenity/JS** you can use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
  to better describe each `Feature` and `Scenario`.

    When she selects "Mega Menu" from the Menu
    When she selects "Desktop" from the Mega Menu
    And she clicks on the "Palm Treo Pro" product
    And she add the product "Palm Treo Pro" to the cart
    Then she should see in the View cart
